# Best practices for commit messages and code comments

## rules for good commit messages

- there should always be a line between the summary and heading
- the summary should be short, if it's too long there may should have been more commits in the first place
- heading and summary start with a capital letter
- there is no dot at the end of heading and summary
- imperative should be used in the commit message
- main text should describe what has been changed and why, not how it was changed

## rules for good code comments 

- comments should not just be a duplication of the code
- good comments dont excuse spaghetti code
- if one is unable to write a good comment about a piece of code, the code itself may not be written well
- comments should make things clear, not confuse the user
- provide links to the sources of code that was copied
- include links to further documentation where it is helpful 
- include comments for bugs that have been fixed
- use TODO to mark incomplete implementations
