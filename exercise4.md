# JUnit Testing

#### Checked Cases

For each method i mainly tested edge cases that include negative numbers or a zero. However i also checked some Exceptions that should be thrown like division by zero or NumberFormatException when trying to parse a String as a number.

The image shows the coverage of the test cases.
